* helm icons

[[file:images/treemacs-icons.gif]]

** Configuration
*** Melpa (TBD)
*** Manual
By default, the provider uses =all-the-icons=, so make sure that you have that
in your load path. If you wish to use =treemacs= icons instead, set =helm-icons-provider=
to ='treemacs=.

Make sure that you have =helm= and your icon provider installed, clone the repo
and put it on your path. Make sure that the enable call is performed before
loading =helm=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(helm-icons-enable)
#+END_SRC

If you use =all-the-icons= and you haven't installed the fonts before, you will be prompted to do so.

** Supported commands:
- =helm-recentf=
- =helm-mini=
- =helm-find-file=
- =helm-buffers-list=
- =helm-locate=
- =helm-fasd=
- =helm-projectile-*=
